> It may also be considered as the maximum amount of force that can be generated in one maximal contraction.[1]
> One repetition maximum can be used for determining an individuals maximum strength and is the method for determining the winner in events such as powerlifting and weightlifting competitions.
> One repetition maximum can also be used as an upper limit, in order to determine the desired "load" for an exercise (as a percentage of the 1RM).
